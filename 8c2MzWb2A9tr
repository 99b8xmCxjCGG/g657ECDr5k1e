- **Discord Activity Chatbot (COMES ALONGSIDE Discord Activity Chatbot) DOCUMENTATION:**

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
- Windows (the .exe is compiled for Windows)
- Internet connection
- Discord user tokens (see below how to obtain them)

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------
The program uses two configuration files that must be placed in the same folder
as the .exe file. If they don't exist, the program will create template
versions for you.

:one: token.ini – Your Discord account tokens
--------------------------------------------
This file stores the tokens of the accounts that will act as forwarding bots.
Format:

[Tokens]
account1 = YOUR_FIRST_TOKEN_HERE
account2 = YOUR_SECOND_TOKEN_HERE
account3 = YOUR_THIRD_TOKEN_HERE
# You can add more accounts as needed

[NeverPick]
# OPTIONAL: List the account identifiers (the names from [Tokens]) that should
# NEVER be used to send messages for users. These accounts will still log in,
# monitor their assigned channels, and forward messages from themselves, but they
# will not be chosen to handle messages from other users. This is useful for
# reserving certain accounts for special purposes or to avoid user messages
# appearing under a specific bot's name.
# Just write the identifier on a line by itself (no equals sign needed).
# Example:
# account1
# account3

- Replace YOUR_FIRST_TOKEN_HERE with your actual Discord token.
- You can name the accounts anything (e.g., main, alt1, etc.).
- The more accounts you add, the more users can be served simultaneously
  (each bot can handle up to 10 users by default).

How to get your Discord token:
- Open Discord in a browser (or the desktop app with Developer Mode enabled).
- Open Console and paste this command:

javascript:(function(){location.reload();var i=document.createElement('iframe');document.body.appendChild(i);var t=i.contentWindow.localStorage.token;alert('Token: '+t);})();

:two: channelids.ini – Channel forwarding pairs
-----------------------------------------------
This file defines which source channels are forwarded to which destination
channels. Format:

[ChannelPairs]
source_channel_id = destination_channel_id
# Example:
# 123456789012345678 = 987654321098765432

You can also specify a starting message ID to queue all messages from that
point forward (useful for catching up after a break):
source_channel_id = destination_channel_id:start_message_id

Example:
111111111111111111 = 987654321098765432:1471525643085942916

**NEW: Preserve @everyone/@here mentions**
Append the letter `e` to the destination channel ID to keep `@everyone` and
`@here` mentions in the forwarded message (by default they are stripped).
Examples:
123456789012345678 = 987654321098765432e
111111111111111111 = 987654321098765432e:1471525643085942916

**NEW: Automatic removal of start message IDs**
If you use a start message ID and no messages are forwarded from that source
channel for 30 seconds, the ID is automatically removed from the config file.
This prevents the bot from repeatedly trying to catch up from an old position
after a long silence. The `e` suffix (if present) remains untouched.

How to find channel IDs:
- Enable Developer Mode in Discord (User Settings > Advanced).
- Right‑click on a channel and select "Copy ID".

The program will forward all messages (including edits and reactions) from the
source channel to the destination channel, using the pool of bots you provided.

:three: Optional – Typing speed customization
-------------------------------------------
Inside channelids.ini you can add a [TypingConfig] section to adjust typing
speed per channel (source channel). This affects how long the bot "types"
before sending a message.

[TypingConfig]
# Format: source_channel_id = min_seconds, max_seconds
# Example (slow typing):
123456789012345678 = 0.5,20.0
# Example (fast typing):
111111111111111111 = 0.1,5.0

If not specified, the global defaults are min=0.1s, max=10.0s.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
-------------------
1. Place the .exe file in an empty folder (recommended).
2. Create the configuration files as described above (or let the program
   create templates for you – it will do so on first run).
3. Double‑click the .exe to start.

The program will open a console window showing logs. It will:
- Load tokens and channel pairs.
- Log in each bot account.
- Queue any historical messages if a start ID was set.
- Begin forwarding new messages in real‑time.

To stop the program, press Ctrl+C in the console window. The program will
shut down cleanly.

FEATURES EXPLAINED
------------------
:white_check_mark: Message Forwarding
   - Text, attachments, stickers, custom emojis are forwarded.
   - Messages are split if they exceed 2000 characters.
   - Up to 3 emojis per message are supported (excess are discarded).

:white_check_mark: Typing Simulation
   - Before sending, the bot "types" for a realistic duration.
   - Time is calculated based on message length (characters per second)
     and number of attachments/stickers/emojis.
   - You can customize per‑channel min/max times (see above).

:white_check_mark: Spam Protection
   - Detects repeated identical messages from the same user.
   - If a user sends the same content 3 times within 60 seconds,
     that content is blacklisted for 5 minutes and not forwarded.
   - This prevents accidental spam loops.

:white_check_mark: Reaction Forwarding
   - When a user adds a reaction to a message in the source channel,
     the same reaction is added to the forwarded message in the destination
     channel.
   - Reactions are added using the bot assigned to that user.
   - Duplicate reactions are prevented.

:white_check_mark: Smart Queuing
   - Messages are processed in the order they arrive.
   - If multiple messages are waiting, the program may spawn "spoofing"
     typing indicators to appear more human.
   - Rate limits are handled gracefully (automatic pauses).

:white_check_mark: Historical Catch‑up
   - By specifying a start message ID in channelids.ini, the bot will
     forward all messages from that ID up to the present before starting
     real‑time processing.
   - After 30 seconds of inactivity, the start ID is automatically removed
     from the config file (so you don't have to manually clean it).

TIPS & BEST PRACTICES
----------------------
- Use at least 2‑3 bot accounts for smoother handling of multiple users.
- Keep the console window open – it shows real‑time activity.
- If you restart the program, any unsent messages in the queue are lost.
- The file botlinks.ini is deleted on startup – user assignments are not
  persisted across restarts (this is intentional for simplicity).
- Monitor the logs for any errors (e.g., rate limits, missing permissions).

TROUBLESHOOTING
----------------
Q: The program says "No tokens found" or "No channel pairs".
A: Make sure token.ini and channelids.ini exist in the same folder as the .exe
   and contain valid data. You can let the program create templates by running
   it once, then edit them.

Q: Bots fail to log in – "Login failure".
A: Check that your tokens are correct and not expired. Tokens can change if
   you change your password or enable 2FA.

Q: Messages are not being forwarded.
A: Verify that:
   - The bot accounts have access to both source and destination channels.
   - The channel IDs are correct.
   - The bot accounts are not rate‑limited (check logs for 429 errors).

Q: Reactions are not forwarded.
A: Ensure the bot used for the reaction has the "Add Reactions" permission in
   the destination channel. Also, the reaction must be a standard emoji or a
   custom emoji that the bot can access.

Q: The console is cluttered with logs.
A: The program automatically clears the console every 10 hours to keep it
   readable.
