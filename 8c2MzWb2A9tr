Greetings! I'm happy to announce some little updates i've brought to the **fixed version of GTA IV** and __new releases!__

While playing again our version of GTA IV, I've discovered that due to **XLiveLessNess Version 1.5.1.1** on it, the game was used to __memory leak after exactly around 40 minutes of gameplay__, which is also a cause of **frequent crashes in multiplayer**. Downgrade to version **1.5.0.1** for fixing this issue. From now on, **while I already stopped to make substancial changes to our version of GTA IV since the Final release tutorial came out, I will also stop to update mods entirely.** This is for ensuring that the game remains to the current state: **bug free**.

The main purpose of our version of GTA IV is to give a gameplay experience as close to vanilla as possible. I've also brought a **minor update to rain**, fixing its __unnatural brightness and geometry__.

Special thanks to @garrytale and @jakzwo for beta testing my changes before release!

Now that we've got GTA covered...
