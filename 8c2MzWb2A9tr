*MANY NEW PROGRAMS RELEASES AND IMPORTANT UPDATES!*

Recently we've been collaborating with @45364645246 for exchanging source codes and valuable material, recently his server just closed due to retards and he just made the choice to protect his stuff under our paywall. Some imgui source codes are already being distributed for VIP members, he also already shared a keyauth bypasser and a trial bypass for exitlag, for more info about those contact me in DM.

For making our products more user friendly I've also released **Galaxy Traveler 15.17**, which adds a new feature under **Options > Use Default Browser**, links will be opened **through user's default browser instead of the integrated Galaxy Traveler's browser.**

*BUT WHY VERSION 15.17 AND NOT JUST FROM 16 TO 17?*

@ihaveanerrection made us notice that our program was **dangerously becoming closer to version number 18**, so for reason that we can't disclose we'll keep it 15 and 17 days, thank you for the contribution!

**NEW PROGRAMS:**
