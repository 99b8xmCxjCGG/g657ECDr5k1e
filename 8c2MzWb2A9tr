From just a few days after the last release, I've decided to publish **Galaxy Traveler 14** implementing some small but important hotfixes, some of them being suggested by C梓C.

**Credentials Retriever** CHANGELOGS

- Fixed the black background, buttons and texts going out of bound on Windows app scaling set to 150%.

**Galactic Player** CHANGELOGS

- I've finally managed to learn how to add support for .mp3 format audio files [Requested by C梓C].
- Added **"ESC"** keybind for deselecting songs from list.
- When no song is selected and "Play" is pressed, the program will play every music in order.
- Added **"Shuffle"** and **"Repeat"** features.
- Added **"Skip" **button.
- Ability to add tracks by drag and dropping.
- Since this component became a little more flexible for being used as an actual simple audio player, the track **"Galaxy Traveler's Originals.mp3** can now be removed.

**Fluxwave** CHANGELOGS

- I've finally managed to fix the infinite amount of bugs that occurred when selecting a font or saving text files, causing mismatching selected fonts on load.
- The program will now notify the user to save changes only when edits are actually detected. Sorry lol I fucking hate coding
