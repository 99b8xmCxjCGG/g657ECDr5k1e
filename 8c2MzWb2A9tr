I know we're a bit late, but **IDA Pro 9.3.251224** is now available for downloading!

**Main changes / highlights**

**Decompiler: new and improved decompilers & microcode** — New RH850 decompiler added; better Golang decompilation improvements (value-range optimizations, microcode improvements, and finer control over assignment propagation / microcode manipulation). The microcode viewer got new interactive features to make microcode editing and inspection easier.

**Type system: Clang/Objective-C + round-trip fixes** — A Clang-based Objective-C parser is now included, `tilib` gains ability to parse C++/Objective-C headers, and new `__fixed(size)` / `__at(offset[, bit])` annotations allow exact struct layouts to round-trip when exporting/importing headers. This fixes a class of lost-offset problems when exporting and re-importing types.

**Golang analysis continued to improve** — More Go types recognized, type names include full package paths (reducing ambiguity), better FUNCINFO and Go version detection, improved string pool handling and metadata parsing (PCLNTAB/FUNCDATA), and generally cleaner Go decompiled output compared to 9.2.

**Teams add-on integrated** — The Teams collaborative add-on is merged into stock IDA (new top-level Teams menu, remote file access from the Vault, HVUI standalone app discontinued).

**Architecture / instruction set expansions & improvements** — New/expanded support for Apple ARM extensions (SVE / SME / MTE intrinsics), RH850/RH850 decompiler, Andes Andestar V3 (NDS32) listing, Tricore improvements (regfinder, switch detection), ARC push/pop idiom recognition, and additional improvements across x86/x64, PowerPC, RISC-V, ARM64. MTE intrinsics are now shown as clean intrinsics instead of inline asm.

**Debuggers & platform updates** — Android 14–17 native debugging improvements, stack view dereferencing improvements, and other debugger widget refinements. New Linux ARM64 installers were added.

**UI/navigation & workflow polish** — Improved Xref Tree and Xref Graph, micro-improvements to performance and responsiveness, and other UI polishing building on the Qt6 migration introduced in 9.2. (9.2 introduced the Qt6 move; 9.3 continues UI refinements.)

**idat / idalib / CLI tweaks** — idat gains safer/better batch behavior (`idat -v`, prevent accidental IDB deletion, batch mode for temporary DBs), and command line switches were adjusted (e.g., `-S` for IDA Home).

**Security / 3rd-party deps updated** — LLVM bumped, Z3, PCRE, libdwarf and other libraries updated to newer, patched versions (security/stability updates).

**Continued bug fixes & stability work** — Numerous bug fixes across UI, processor modules, decompiler, and general stability improvements were applied.
