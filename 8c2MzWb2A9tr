I've dropped **Galaxy Traveler 22**, dropping some very important changes to how user Data is stored and handled, for the users who have already registered once and need to re-register, the process is now easier.

**ADDED THE FOLLOWING FEATURES** UNDER ** OPTIONS > MAINTENANCE CASCADE MENU**:

**- Backup user data**
**- Load User Data Backup**
**- Clear User Data**
**- Backup Credentials**
**- Also featuring checkable feature "Use Default Browser for Custom Links"**

**UNDER MISC:**

- Added **Custom** under **Misc**, you will be able to add and remove your custom links.

**GENERAL QOF IMPROVEMENTS:**

- Program will remember last resolution on closure
- User data will be stored inside **C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\SunsetClub**
- Ability to automatically insert credentials through your credentials' backup during registration.
- When logging out, **"Backup and Logout"** alongside **Logout without Backup**, which will automatically backup your credentials on logout but not your license information.
