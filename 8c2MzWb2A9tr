**Galaxy Traveler 26CE** is OUT!

**Changelog:**

- After improving our Forum's security, we've radically changed the protection layers of our software too (Current licenses will be valid)

- Galaxy Traveler's **"Party Mode"** will be remembered active on next program run.

- Fixed an issue where when Licenses' domain was partially unavailable, it would've triggered an anti-piracy measure, deleting user's license files.

- Galaxy Traveler's license login form **"Submit"** button has been renamed to **"Request Gateway"** for making it more user friendly.

- **Galactic Player** window is now shorter for fitting on 1920 x 1080 125% resolutions, program will now remember last volume used on next runs.

- **Rine** now features "Repeat loop: HH:MM:SS" and "Close button should minimize the Rine window" features, it will remember user's preferences on next program run, fixed checkboxes' broken outlines.

- **Chromaflow** will now remember selected **"Translate From"** and **"Translate To"** languages on next program run.
